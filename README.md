# AOC2020
This respository contians my solutions of [AOC2020](https://adventofcode.com/).
AOC is a Christmas countdown event featuring solving puzzles. Below is the description of the AOC from its website:
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.  

You may download or clone this repository. In each day's folder you can replace the content of `inputs.txt` with your input or testing data, then you may run the code with node to see the answer.
For example, if you want to checkout day13 question 2, after you replace the content of `inputs.txt`, you may run:
```
node day13-2.js
```
then it will output the answer.
