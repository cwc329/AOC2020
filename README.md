# AOC2020
This is my solutions of AOC2020.
You may download or clone this repository. In each day's folder you can replace the content of `inputs.txt` with your input or testing data, then you may run the code with node to see the answer.
For example, if you want to checkout day13 question 2, after you replace the content of `inputs.txt`, you may run:
```
node day13-2.js
```
then it will output the answer.
